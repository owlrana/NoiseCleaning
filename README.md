**_Rahul Rana**, **J Chadwik_**

**Abstract**:

_The fundamental aim of this project is to automate the process of Audio Cleaning and Audio Mixing for Voice-Overs or Audio Recordings in videos. This is achieved by the following features: '**Selecting a noise base** (to set-up and store the information about noise floor', '**De-Noising the file using previously selected base** (to mute sections containing ONLY the noise floor and imitating de-Noise plugin with EQ', '**controlling dynamics:** **Compression** (modifiable Threshold [-60dB to 0dB], Ratio [1:1 to 1:30], Make-Up Gain [-20 to 50 dB], Attack [0 to 200 ms], Release [ 5 to 5k ms]), **Limiter**, **Equalization** (Channel, Linear, Match, Single Band), and finally **Normalisation** (Increasing the final Signal to anywhere between -1 dB to -0.1dB to prevent distortion)_
